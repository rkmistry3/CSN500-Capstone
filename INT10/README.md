## INT10
## Student Name: Ritesh Mistry
## Professor Name: Atoosa Nasiri

# Teaching methods and strategies:
```
I would definitely recommend the students studying in my course to take this 
subject with the professors as I believe it has been one of the most engaging 
courses to study. There has been great interaction between the professor and the students.
Also, the professor has been constantly working to solve the doubts of the students and post
the videos too for the future reference.
```

# Personal connection
```
I do not know the professor and this is the first time I studied with both the 
professors and it has been one of the better experiences with the professor as 
they constantly engage with the students regarding the doubts and also help each and every
student in completing their work. Also, I have attended the class and it is more of a 
relaxing atmosphere to study with them despite the course is not that easy.
```
# Course materials
```
The course is not in the category of the professional courses but the material is very 
professional as compared to others and also it seems very helpful when it comes to networking.
Also, the introduction of the github is one of the best parts as we get an opportunity to explore more
different ways to merge in to the professional field in the future.
```

# General rating
`
I would say it was an overall 8/10 course. The two points are for the level of 
difficulty that the checkpoints has and its troubleshooting.
`
# Suggestions
```
The weight of the grades should not only rely on the checkpoints
More time shall be given to complete the checkpoints as it requires more time
The interactive exercises shall be given more importance as they teach many useful things
The checkpoints shall be introduced earlier in the course and there should be special sessions for its
troubleshooting
```
# Course content
```
I would remove the azure and bring complete github and all the work should be done using 
the github

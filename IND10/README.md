# Working with github
`
It has been one of the best experiences while studying the course
as it is easy and more fun to study than the azure or any other services
`

# Teaching material
`
The teaching material has been very useful as it helped me in other
subjects as well. The work in the checkpoints is very useful in the other
networking courses.
`

# Demo sessions
`
The demo sessions were the best part about this course as all the 
exercises had one session held for the troubleshooting which can be accessed anytime
and with its help we can learn and troubleshoot outside the class without anyone else's
help.
`

# Assignments
`
The content given was proper for the assignments but I feel that more time
should be given to complete the work and the assignments specially when it comes to the 
checkpoints
`

# Github in professional career
`
I believe that github will prove to be useful as there arent many people that 
are taught github and it is also easier and more fun as compared to other services
when it comes to working on it.
`

# Elimination
`
If I could have, i would remove the checkpoints in azure and find an alternative way to 
learn the skills that the checkpoint was trying to teach the students.
